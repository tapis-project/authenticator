## 1.3.0 - 2023-03-12
This production point release adds support for TACC MFA, token revocation, token tracking 
for usage analytics and a number of bug fixes. 
NOTE: This version of Authenticator depends on the Site Router API for Token revocation, not
previously released. 

### Breaking Changes:

### Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug in the way authenticator called `jwt.decode` when decoding a CII token. Due to a recent upgrade to the Python JWT library in flaskbase, we must specify the algorithm used to decode -- in this case, `HS256`. (originally released in 1.2.1)


## 1.2.5 - 2022-09-15

This feature allows users to compute usage data such as how many distinct users generated access tokens in
each tenant.

### Breaking Changes:
- None.

### New features:
- Adds new SQL tables for tracking access tokens and refresh tokens generated by authenticator (#22). 
- Add additional indexes to the Clients and TenantConfigs table; (this update provided as a separate migration).

## 1.2.2 - 2022-07-29
This preview release adds support for the TACC MFA solution, which can be configured for tenants using the 
TACC identity provider (TACC LDAP) on a tenant by tenant basis. It also adds a new endpoint for exchanging 
a v3 access token for a Tapis v2 token. This feature is also only available for certain tenants. 

### Breaking Changes:

Python JWT library.

### Breaking Changes:
- None.

### New features:
- None.

### Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug in the way authenticator called `jwt.decode` when decoding a CII token. Due to a recent upgrade to the Python JWT lobrary in flaskbase, we must specify the algorithm used to decode -- in this case, `HS256`.


## 1.2.0 - 2022-05-30
This release adds support for the device code grant type and OAuth2 authentication
via TACC's Keycloak instance to support third-party identity providers, including
Globus Auth.

### Breaking Changes:
- None.

mechanism is used when a tenant configures a custom idp configuration of type `tacc_keycloak`. See issue #18 for more details.
- Adds health check and ready endpoints.

### Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug in the way authenticator computed the `default_user_filter_prefix` that was causing two equals signs (`=`) to get inserted into the filter. 


## 1.1.0 - 2022-03-01
This release converts the Authenticator to using the new `tapipy-tapisservice` plugin-based 
Tapis Python SDK and makes updates necessary for supporting deployment automation provided
by the Tapis Deployer project.

### Breaking Changes:
- None.

### New features:
- Convert Authenticator to using the new `tapis/flaskbase-plugins` image.
- Support the initial version of the Tapis Deployer deployment automation.
