# Developer Docs
Here, we document information useful when developing the Tapis Authenticator.

At a high level, this project is based on the AuthLib project - https://github.com/lepture/authlib - a Python library
for building OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Details regarding the Flask OAuth2 provider server implementation can
be found here: https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/flask/2/index.html
